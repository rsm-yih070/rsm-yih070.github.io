Their marketing team would like to make the claim that patent applicants using Blueprinty's software are more successful in getting their patent applications approved. Ideal data to study such an effect might include the success rate of patent applications before using Blueprinty's software and after using it. Unfortunately, such data is not available. \n",

The marketing team would like to use this data to make the claim that firms using Blueprinty's software are more successful in getting their patent applications approved.\n",
