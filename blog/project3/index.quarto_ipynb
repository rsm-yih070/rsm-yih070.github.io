The outcome variable is the identity of the product chosen $y_i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, J\\}$ or equivalently a vector of $J-1$ zeros and $1$ one, where the $1$ indicates the selected product. For example, if the third product was chosen out of 3 products, then either $y=3$ or $y=(0,0,1)$ depending on how we want to represent it. Suppose also that we have a vector of data on each product $x_j$ (eg, brand, price, etc.). \n",

        "\n",
        "The comparison of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Bayesian posterior summaries reveals close alignment in the estimated parameters, indicating robustness of the model across estimation methods. With this in mind, we interpret the parameter estimates as if they had been obtained from real (non-simulated) data and discuss the potential implications for modeling preference heterogeneity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Interpretation of Parameter Estimates\n",
        "\n",
        "If these parameter estimates were derived from actual consumer data, they would yield valuable insights into preferences over key streaming service attributes, including brand, advertising, and price.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Relative Brand Preferences\n",
        "\n",
        "The estimate for $\\beta_{\\text{Netflix}}$ is larger than that for $\\beta_{\\text{Prime}}$, both of which are positive relative to the reference category, Hulu. This suggests that, all else equal, consumers derive the highest utility from Netflix, followed by Amazon Prime, and then Hulu. In practical terms, this implies a clear brand preference hierarchy that aligns with Netflix's market leadership and perceived content quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Effect of Advertisements\n",
        "\n",
        "The negative coefficient on the `ads` variable indicates that advertisement inclusion reduces the utility of a streaming service. This result is consistent with consumer expectations and supports the idea that ad-free plans are generally preferred. For ad-supported models to be attractive, they may need to offer lower pricing or other incentives.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Price Sensitivity\n",
        "\n",
        "The negative sign of the $\\beta_{\\text{price}}$ coefficient aligns with standard economic theory: higher prices reduce the probability that a product will be chosen. The estimated magnitude suggests that each additional dollar in monthly subscription cost reduces utility by approximately 0.1 units, providing a quantifiable measure of consumers' price sensitivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the parameter estimates are intuitive and align with expectations. They reflect strong brand preferences, disutility from advertisements, and rational sensitivity to pricing—factors critical for effective product design and positioning in the streaming services market.\n",

        "---\n",

        "### Toward More Realistic Preference Modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "While the fixed-parameter MNL model offers valuable insights, it assumes that all consumers share the same preferences. In real-world applications, this assumption is overly restrictive. To account for **heterogeneity in preferences**, a more flexible model is required.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Extension to a Hierarchical (Random-Parameter) Model\n",
        "\n",
        "A more realistic framework for analyzing conjoint data is the **hierarchical multinomial logit model** (also known as the **mixed logit model**). This model relaxes the assumption of homogeneous preferences by allowing each individual to have their own set of preference parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Simulating Data\n",
        "\n",
        "To simulate data under a hierarchical structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Define a **distribution over individual-level parameters**, such as $\\beta_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma)$, instead of assuming fixed effects.\n",
        "- For each individual $i$, draw a personalized vector of preferences $\\beta_i$ from this distribution.\n",
        "- Use these respondent-specific parameters to simulate choices, capturing variation in how different individuals value features like brand, ads, and price.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process generates richer data that reflects the natural diversity in consumer preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Estimation Adjustments\n",
        "\n",
        "To estimate the parameters of a hierarchical MNL model, we must integrate over the distribution of individual-level betas, which introduces computational complexity:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The resulting **likelihood function** contains an integral over the unobserved heterogeneity, which typically lacks a closed-form solution.\n",
        "- Two common approaches to estimation are:\n",
        "  - **Hierarchical Bayesian estimation**, which uses MCMC to jointly estimate the individual-level parameters and population-level hyperparameters ($\\mu$, $\\Sigma$).\n",
        "  - **Maximum Simulated Likelihood (MSL)**, which approximates the integral by averaging over simulated draws from the assumed distribution of $\\beta_i$.\n",
        "\n",
        "These methods allow us to recover both:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The **population distribution of preferences**, which informs aggregate-level strategies,\n",
