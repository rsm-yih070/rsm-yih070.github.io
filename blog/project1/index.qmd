## Introduction

Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the [AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.97.5.1774) and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of [Harvard's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27853&version=4.2).

_to do: expand on the description of the experiment._

This project seeks to replicate their results.

### Balance Test 

As an ad hoc test of the randomization mechanism, I provide a series of tests that compare aspects of the treatment and control groups to assess whether they are statistically significantly different from one another.

_todo: test a few variables other than the key outcome variables (for example, test months since last donation) to see if the treatment and control groups are statistically significantly different at the 95% confidence level. Do each as a t-test and separately as a linear regression, and confirm you get the exact same results from both methods. When doing a t-test, use the formula in the class slides. When doing the linear regression, regress for example mrm2 on treatment and look at the estimated coefficient on the treatment variable. It might be helpful to compare parts of your analysis to Table 1 in the paper. Be sure to comment on your results (hint: why is Table 1 included in the paper)._

### "mrm2"
```{python}
treat = df[df['treatment'] == 1]['mrm2']
control = df[df['treatment'] == 0]['mrm2']

mean_treat = treat.mean()
mean_control = control.mean()
var_treat = treat.var(ddof=1)
var_control = control.var(ddof=1)
n_treat = treat.count()
n_control = control.count()

numerator = mean_treat - mean_control
denominator = np.sqrt(var_treat / n_treat + var_control / n_control)
t_stat = numerator / denominator

print("Mean Treatment:", round(mean_treat,3))
print("Std Treatment:", round(np.sqrt(var_treat),3))

print("Mean Control:", round(mean_control,3))
print("Std Control:", round(np.sqrt(var_control),3))
print("Overall Mean:", round(df['mrm2'].mean(),3))
print("Overall Std:", round(df['mrm2'].std(),3))
print("t test:", t_stat)

```

```{python}
model = rsm.model.regress(data = df, rvar = 'mrm2', evar = 'treatment')
model.summary()
```

The manual t-test and linear regression results for mrm2 (months since last donation) show no statistically significant difference between the treatment and control groups (t ≈ 0.12, p ≈ 0.905), indicating that this key pre-treatment variable is well balanced. This supports the validity of the random assignment and confirms that the experimental groups are comparable before the intervention. Table 1 is included in the paper to show that randomization produced balanced groups across a wide range of covariates, ensuring that any observed differences in outcomes can be attributed to the treatment rather than pre-existing differences.

### "hpa"
```{python}
treat = df[df['treatment'] == 1]['hpa']
control = df[df['treatment'] == 0]['hpa']

mean_treat = treat.mean()
mean_control = control.mean()
var_treat = treat.var(ddof=1)
var_control = control.var(ddof=1)
n_treat = treat.count()
n_control = control.count()

numerator = mean_treat - mean_control
denominator = np.sqrt(var_treat / n_treat + var_control / n_control)
t_stat = numerator / denominator

print("Mean Treatment:", round(mean_treat,3))
print("Std Treatment:", round(np.sqrt(var_treat),3))

print("Mean Control:", round(mean_control,3))
print("Std Control:", round(np.sqrt(var_control),3))
print("Overall Mean:", round(df['hpa'].mean(),3))
print("Overall Std:", round(df['hpa'].std(),3))
print("t test:", t_stat)
```

```{python}
model = rsm.model.regress(data = df, rvar = 'hpa', evar = 'treatment')
model.summary()
```

The hpa variable is a pre-treatment covariate, so the lack of a significant difference across groups provides evidence that random assignment was successful. In particular, it suggests that prior donation behavior (as measured by the highest past contribution) was balanced across the treatment and control conditions. This supports the validity of any causal claims made later in the experiment, as we can reasonably assume that any post-treatment differences in donation behavior are due to the treatment itself rather than pre-existing differences in donor generosity.

### "freq"
```{python}
treat = df[df['treatment'] == 1]['freq']
control = df[df['treatment'] == 0]['freq']

mean_treat = treat.mean()
mean_control = control.mean()
var_treat = treat.var(ddof=1)
var_control = control.var(ddof=1)
n_treat = treat.count()
n_control = control.count()

numerator = mean_treat - mean_control
denominator = np.sqrt(var_treat / n_treat + var_control / n_control)
t_stat = numerator / denominator

print("Mean Treatment:", round(mean_treat,3))
print("Std Treatment:", round(np.sqrt(var_treat),3))

print("Mean Control:", round(mean_control,3))
print("Std Control:", round(np.sqrt(var_control),3))
print("Overall Mean:", round(df['freq'].mean(),3))
print("Overall Std:", round(df['freq'].std(),3))
print("t test:", t_stat)
```

```{python}
model = rsm.model.regress(data = df, rvar = 'freq', evar = 'treatment')
model.summary()
```

The variable freq, representing the number of prior donations, shows nearly identical means between the treatment and control groups. Both the manual t-test and regression confirm that this difference is not statistically significant. This suggests that random assignment successfully balanced this pre-treatment characteristic, which supports the internal validity of the experimental design. Because the treatment and control groups are statistically equivalent in terms of donation frequency history, we can be more confident that any observed post-treatment effects on donation behavior are attributable to the treatment rather than pre-existing differences in donor activity.

## Experimental Results

### Charitable Contribution Made

First, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation. 

_todo: make a barplot with two bars. Each bar is the proportion of people who donated. One bar for treatment and one bar for control._

```{python}
prop_donated = df.groupby('treatment')['gave'].mean().reset_index()
prop_donated['group'] = prop_donated['treatment'].map({0: 'Control', 1: 'Treatment'})

sns.barplot(data=prop_donated, x='group', y='gave')
plt.ylabel("Proportion Who Donated")
plt.title("Donation Rate by Group")
plt.show()
```

_todo: run a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made. Also run a bivariate linear regression that demonstrates the same finding. (It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A.) Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)_

```{python}
treat = df[df['treatment'] == 1]['gave']
control = df[df['treatment'] == 0]['gave']

mean_diff = treat.mean() - control.mean()
var_treat = treat.var()
var_control = control.var()
n_treat = len(treat)
n_control = len(control)

t_stat = mean_diff / np.sqrt(var_treat / n_treat + var_control / n_control)
print("T-statistic:", t_stat)
```

```{python}
model = rsm.model.regress(data = df, rvar = 'gave', evar = 'treatment')
model.summary()
```

The statistical analysis shows that individuals who received the treatment — a matching donation offer — were significantly more likely to make a charitable contribution compared to those who received the control letter. Both the t-test and linear regression indicate that this difference is unlikely to be due to chance. This suggests that the presence of a matching grant acts as a powerful motivator, nudging people toward taking action. In the context of human behavior, this reveals that even a subtle change in framing — like knowing one's gift will be matched — can meaningfully increase the likelihood of giving. It highlights how social cues or perceived amplification of impact can influence decision-making in charitable contexts.


_todo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control. Confirm that your results replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper._

```{python}
from statsmodels.discrete.discrete_model import Probit

probit_model = Probit.from_formula('gave ~ treatment', data=df)
probit_result = probit_model.fit()
print(probit_result.summary())
mfx = probit_result.get_margeff()
print(mfx.summary())
```

### Differences between Match Rates

Next, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.

_todo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the "figures suggest" comment the authors make on page 8?_

```{python}
# t-test between 2:1 and 1:1 ratios
gave_1_1 = df[df['ratio'] == 1]['gave']
gave_2_1 = df[df['ratio'] == 2]['gave']

from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
t_stat, p_val = ttest_ind(gave_2_1, gave_1_1, equal_var=False)

print("2:1 vs 1:1 Match Rate:")
print(f"T-stat: {t_stat:.3f}, P-value: {p_val:.3f}")
```

```{python}
# t-test between 3:1 and 1:1 ratios
gave_3_1 = df[df['ratio'] == 3]['gave']
gave_1_1 = df[df['ratio'] == 1]['gave']

t_stat, p_val = ttest_ind(gave_3_1, gave_1_1, equal_var=False)
print("3:1 vs 1:1 Match Rate:")
print(f"T-stat: {t_stat:.3f}, P-value: {p_val:.3f}")
```

```{python}
# t-test between 3:1 and 2:1 ratios
gave_3_1 = df[df['ratio'] == 3]['gave']
gave_2_1 = df[df['ratio'] == 2]['gave']

t_stat, p_val = ttest_ind(gave_3_1, gave_2_1, equal_var=False)
print("3:1 vs 2:1 Match Rate:")
print(f"T-stat: {t_stat:.3f}, P-value: {p_val:.3f}")
```

My results clearly support the authors' conclusion: while higher match ratios may show slightly higher donation rates numerically, those differences are not statistically significant, and therefore do not provide strong evidence that larger match sizes are more effective than 1:1 matches.


_todo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable `ratio1` then regress `gave` on `ratio1`, `ratio2`, and `ratio3` (or alternatively, regress `gave` on the categorical variable `ratio`). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision._

```{python}
model = rsm.model.regress(data = df, rvar = 'gave', evar = 'ratio')
model.summary()
```

Regression results show that all three match ratios (1:1, 2:1, 3:1) are associated with slightly higher donation rates compared to the control group, but the differences are small. The coefficient for ratio[1] (1:1 match) is 0.003 and marginally significant (p = 0.097), while the coefficients for ratio[2] (2:1) and ratio[3] (3:1) are both 0.005 and statistically significant at the 1% level (p = 0.006 and p = 0.005). However, the differences between them are not large in magnitude — all are within 0.002 of each other — suggesting that although offering any match tends to increase donations, there is little evidence that larger match sizes lead to proportionally greater increases. This supports the conclusion that the presence of a match matters more than its generosity, and that people are generally responsive to the signal of support, not necessarily the size of the match.

_todo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios.  Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?_

```{python}
p_1_1 = df[df['ratio'] == 1]['gave'].mean()
p_2_1 = df[df['ratio'] == 2]['gave'].mean()
p_3_1 = df[df['ratio'] == 3]['gave'].mean()

print("Response rates:")
print(f"1:1 = {p_1_1*100:.3f}%, 2:1 = {p_2_1*100:.3f}%, 3:1 = {p_3_1*100:.3f}%")
```

Differences (From Regression Coefficients):

2:1 − 1:1 = 0.005 − 0.003 = 0.002

3:1 − 2:1 = 0.005 − 0.005 = 0.000


Both the raw response rates and regression coefficients indicate that increasing the match from 1:1 to 2:1 produces a small increase in the probability of donating (about 0.2 percentage points), while moving from 2:1 to 3:1 shows virtually no change. These differences are very modest in size, and the lack of improvement from 2:1 to 3:1 suggests diminishing returns to increasing match generosity. The findings reinforce the conclusion that offering any match increases donations, but offering a larger match ratio does not lead to proportionally greater giving. The signal of a match itself may be more powerful than the actual amount matched.

### Size of Charitable Contribution

In this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.

_todo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?_

```{python}
model = rsm.model.regress(data = df, rvar = 'amount', evar = 'treatment')
model.summary()
```

From this analysis, we learn that individuals who received the matching grant treatment donated slightly more on average than those in the control group, but the difference is only marginally statistically significant (p = 0.063). The treatment effect estimate suggests that the treatment group gave about 15 cents more per person than the control group, which is a small increase. This result implies that the primary effect of the matching grant is likely driven by increasing the number of people who give, rather than substantially increasing the donation amounts of those who would already have donated. It highlights that while the match offer motivates more people to donate, it doesn't strongly influence how much they give on average.

_todo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients -- what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?_ 

```{python}
model = rsm.model.regress(data = df[df['gave'] == 1], rvar = 'amount', evar = 'treatment')
model.summary()
```

The regression results show that among individuals who made a donation, the treatment group gave slightly less on average than the control group, but this difference (−1.67) is not statistically significant (p = 0.561). This tells us that the matching grant treatment did not affect the amount given by those who chose to donate. In other words, the presence of a match increased the number of people who gave, but not how much they gave once they decided to give.


As for causal interpretation: since this regression is limited only to people who donated, it suffers from selection bias — treatment may have influenced who donated, and the group of donors in treatment and control may differ in unobserved ways. Therefore, the treatment coefficient cannot be interpreted causally in this conditional regression. Only the earlier regression using the full sample (which preserves random assignment) supports a causal interpretation of treatment effects.

_todo: Make two plot: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot._

```{python}
donors = df[df['gave'] == 1]

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5), sharey=True)
sns.histplot(donors[donors['treatment'] == 0]['amount'], bins=30, ax=axes[0], color='skyblue')
axes[0].axvline(donors[donors['treatment'] == 0]['amount'].mean(), color='red', linestyle='--')
axes[0].set_title('Control Group')

## Simulation Experiment

As a reminder of how the t-statistic "works," in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.

Suppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made. 

Further suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size  is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.

### Law of Large Numbers

_to do:  Make a plot like those on slide 43 from our first class and explain the plot to the reader. To do this, you will simulate 100,00 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You'll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you'll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. Comment on whether the cumulative average approaches the true difference in means._

```{python}
n = 10000
p_control = 0.018
p_treatment = 0.022
true_diff = p_treatment - p_control 

control = np.random.binomial(1, p_control, n)
treatment = np.random.binomial(1, p_treatment, n)

diffs = treatment - control 

cumulative_avg = np.cumsum(diffs) / np.arange(1, n + 1)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(cumulative_avg, label='Cumulative Average Difference')
plt.axhline(true_diff, color='red', linestyle='--', label='True Difference = 0.004')
plt.title('Law of Large Numbers: Cumulative Average of Treatment - Control')
plt.xlabel('Number of Simulated Pairs')
plt.ylabel('Average Difference')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

The cumulative average of the difference in donation outcomes between the treatment and control groups begins with high variability but quickly stabilizes as more simulated pairs are added. By around 1,000–2,000 iterations, the average difference converges very closely to the true population difference of 0.004, shown by the red dashed line. This confirms that as the sample size increases, the sample average becomes a reliable and consistent estimator of the population average. In other words, the plot clearly shows that the cumulative average approaches the true difference in means, which is exactly what the Law of Large Numbers predicts.



### Central Limit Theorem

_to do: Make 4 histograms like those on slide 44 from our first class at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000 and explain these plots to the reader. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. Comment on whether zero is in the "middle" of the distribution or whether it's in the "tail."_

```{python}
p_control = 0.018
p_treatment = 0.022
true_diff = p_treatment - p_control
n_sim = 1000
sample_sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]

fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(14, 10))
axes = axes.flatten()

for i, n in enumerate(sample_sizes):
    avg_diffs = []

    for _ in range(n_sim):
        control_sample = np.random.binomial(1, p_control, n)
        treatment_sample = np.random.binomial(1, p_treatment, n)
        diff = treatment_sample.mean() - control_sample.mean()
        avg_diffs.append(diff)
    
    sns.histplot(avg_diffs, bins=30, kde=True, stat="frequency", color="blue", ax=axes[i])
    axes[i].axvline(0, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2)
    axes[i].set_title(f"Sample size = {n}", fontsize=14)
    axes[i].set_xlabel("Mean Difference (Treatment - Control)")
    axes[i].set_ylabel("Frequency")

plt.suptitle("Central Limit Theorem Simulation", fontsize=16, y=1.02)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

In the histogram for a sample size of 50, the distribution is wide and irregular, and zero appears near the center — indicating that at this small sample size, it's still quite common to observe no difference between treatment and control groups due to random variation. As the sample size increases to 200 and 500, the distributions become more symmetric and bell-shaped, with zero gradually shifting away from the peak. By the time we reach a sample size of 1000, the distribution is tightly centered around a positive value, and zero clearly lies in the tail of the distribution. This shift demonstrates how larger samples improve our ability to detect even small differences and reduce the likelihood of falsely concluding that there’s no effect when one actually exists. In short, as sample size increases, zero moves from the middle toward the tails, confirming the predictions of the Central Limit Theorem and the increasing statistical power of larger samples.
